# project-1

Using a csv file downloaded from Data.gov, looked at ridership numbers for CTA 'L' train stops for the years from 2013 to 2023.  Cleaned up the data to eliminate any stations that were missing months, or had 0 for columns.  Created 3 graphs to show total CTA 'L' ridership for the years 2013-2023, a graph showing how many stations fit into each bin that I created, pre and post COVID, and finally a graph showing ridership averages for the top 25 stations, pre and post COVID

# First commit, initial upload of cleaned up dataframe from csv file downloaded from data.gov
# Second commit, completed coding
# Third commit, finished plotting graphs and saving them
