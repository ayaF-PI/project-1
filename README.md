CTA Ridership Analysis

(busiest month)

#OVERVIEW This project analyzes the monthly ridership data for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to identify and visualize the busiest months over the years. The analysis includes data cleaning, trend visualization, and correlation assessment to provide insights into peak ridership periods.

##Project Components Data Analysis: Identifies trends and patterns in monthly ridership data. Visualization: Provides bar and pie charts to visualize ridership trends and busiest months. Correlation Analysis: Assesses the relationship between ridership, year, and month.

###Results Monthly CTA Ridership Over Years: A bar chart showing total ridership by month across different years. Top Busiest Months: Pie charts displaying the top 5 and top 10 busiest months for CTA ridership. Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix showing the relationship between year, month, and ridership.

####Visualization Examples Bar Chart: Monthly CTA Ridership Over Years

Pie Chart (Top 5): Top 5 Busiest Months for CTA

Pie Chart (Top 10): Top 10 Busiest Months for CTA

#####Conclusion October is consistently the busiest month for CTA ridership. The average ridership in the top 5 busiest months is higher compared to the top 10. The year-to-year and month-to-month variations show minimal correlation with ridership, indicating other influencing factors.

######Recommendations Increase service frequency during October to manage peak demand. Analyze specific events or factors in October that contribute to high ridership for better planning.


busiest station

Using a csv file downloaded from Data.gov, looked at ridership numbers for CTA 'L' train stops for the years from 2013 to 2023.  Cleaned up the data to eliminate any stations that were missing months, or had 0 for columns.  Created 3 graphs to show total CTA 'L' ridership for the years 2013-2023, a graph showing how many stations fit into each bin that I created, pre and post COVID, and finally a graph showing ridership averages for the top 25 stations, pre and post COVID

# First commit, initial upload of cleaned up dataframe from csv file downloaded from data.gov
# Second commit, completed coding
# Third commit, finished plotting graphs and saving them
